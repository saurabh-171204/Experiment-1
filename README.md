## AIM
To learn and implement basics of C++

# APPARATUS
VS CODE

# THEORY
Structure: C++ programs consist of functions, with the main() function as the entry point.
Variables: Declare with type (int, float, double, char, bool) before use.
Input/Output: Use cin for input and cout for output (from <iostream>).
Control structures:

if/else for conditional execution
for, while, do-while loops for iteration


Functions: Reusable code blocks with parameters and return values.
Classes and objects: Basic units of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
Memory management: Manual allocation/deallocation with new and delete.
Standard Template Library (STL): Provides common data structures and algorithms.
Pointers: Store memory addresses, allowing direct memory manipulation.
References: Aliases for existing variables.

#CODE 
```
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){
    cout<<"Hello World";
    return 0;
}
```
